### Sum Tree
A binary tree shall be considered a sum tree if, for every node in the tree, the value of the node corresponds to the sum of all its descendants (including grandchildren, etc.). Leaf nodes may have arbitrary values.

Write a function that determines if a given binary tree is a valid sum tree.

An example of a sum tree is shown below:
```
     26
    /  \
  10    3
 /  \    \
4    6    3
```
